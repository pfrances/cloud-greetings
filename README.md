# Cloud Greetings

## Description
Cloud Greetings is a sandbox project for learning and experimenting with cloud technologies, microservices, and Infrastructure as Code (IaC). The project consists of simple "Hello World" style services that communicate with each other in a cloud environment.

## Project Goals
- Learn and practice containerization with Docker
- Implement basic microservices in Go, TypeScript, and Kotlin
- Deploy services to AWS using Terraform
- Set up a basic CI/CD pipeline
- Experiment with cloud monitoring and logging

## Components
1. Go Service (Greeter)
2. TypeScript Service (Translator)
3. Kotlin Service (Orchestrator)
4. React Frontend

## Technologies
- Languages: Go, TypeScript, Kotlin, JavaScript (React)
- Cloud Provider: AWS
- IaC: Terraform
- Containerization: Docker
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Monitoring: AWS CloudWatch

## Getting Started
(To be filled as the project progresses)

## Development Roadmap
1. Set up local development environment
2. Create and test services locally
3. Containerize services with Docker
4. Write Terraform scripts for AWS infrastructure
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline with GitHub Actions
6. Deploy to AWS
7. Implement basic monitoring and logging

## Current Status
Project is in initial setup phase. Local development environment is being configured.

## Next Steps
- [ ] Initialize Go service
- [ ] Initialize TypeScript service
- [ ] Initialize Kotlin service
- [ ] Create basic React frontend
- [ ] Write Dockerfiles for each service
